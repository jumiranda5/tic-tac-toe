# Tic Tac Toe
#### Description:

Javascript [exercise](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-tic-tac-toe) from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com).

A simple game of tic tac toe, built with Javascript to practice the usage of factory functions. Users can play against another user or against a bot. The minimax function for the bot was quite a challenge to implement, but it seams to be working.
